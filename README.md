# emojifier

A very stupid website for stupid reasons.

Built using Hugo. 


## Local development

If you don't already have it: `brew install hugo` ([what's brew?](https://brew.sh/))

Then run the site with `hugo server`. 

## Deployment
Hugo builds this as a static site, so no server needed. Both Netlify and Vercel are capable of building and deploying Hugo sites with very little config.
