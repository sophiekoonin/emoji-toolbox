# emojifier

A very stupid website for stupid reasons. Extremely specific emoji generator, based on some of the memes in my work Slack.

Built with Canvas using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), with a little help from [Konva](https://github.com/konvajs/konva) for some of the more complicated transforms. 

## Why?

why not?

## Local development

If you don't already have it: `brew install hugo` ([what's brew?](https://brew.sh/))

Then run the site with `hugo server`. 

## Deployment
Hugo builds this as a static site, so no server needed. Both Netlify and Vercel are capable of building and deploying Hugo sites with very little config.
